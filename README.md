# ReactJS Websocket Chatroom
Technologies used: ReactJS, BootstrapCSS, Node.js

This is just a fun project I felt like coding up in a day.  If you can't tell from the title this project is just a simple client side powered ReactJS websocket chatroom.

I plan on deploying this to Heroku some time this.
